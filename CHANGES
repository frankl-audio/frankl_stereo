        Changes between published versions

0.9 to 0.9.2

- newer assembler functions for aarch64 for refreshing and cleaning memory,
  shuffles date through many floating point registers. Clear further
  improvement on authors setup with Odroid C4.

- several *_c4 programs for authors setup with Odroid C4, uses assembler
  code for precise timing (variant should work on Raspi 4).

- utility by4 for authors setup (64 bit float in 192k to 32 bit signed int
  in 48k, adds silence and changes zero samples)

- use new options and add explanations in example improvefile script

- added new option --number-copies to various programs (or --out-copies
  for bufhrt); here refreshs are done through a loop of temporary buffers.

- added options for slower refreshs in RAM to bufhrt

0.8 to 0.9

- new example script play_resample.

- new default parameters and some explanation in example script
  improvefile

- improved assembler code for refreshing memory on AA64.

- added options --number-copies for "improve in RAM" for bufhrt, cptoshm.

- introduced nf files for storing (music) data directly in block device
  (e.g., SD card or other flash device) without any file system overhead.
  Created with music2nf (in "improvefile" quality) and can be used with
  writeloop or resample_soxr.

- fixed a problem with using assembler code for refreshing memory
  on x86_64 and aarch64.

- highrestest with optional integer parameter does a 10 second
  with 10000 sleeps for statistics about actual presision
  (try 'highrestest 500')

- new option --dsyncs-per-second for bufhrt, used in improvefile

0.7 to 0.8

- now using resample_soxr in example script with upsampling.

- added option -I for 32-bit integer output to resample_soxr.

- added experimental programs clreg/clref86 to clean CPU registers,
  see INSTALL file.

- added assembler code for refreshing memory for aarch86 and x86_64.

- enabled files > 2G in all input and output.

- added some missing short options to playhrt.

- added option --precision to resample_soxr.

- added --replay-gain option to resample_soxr and volrace.

- fixed possible segfault of resample_soxr in rare
  cases of parameter combinations involving RACE.

- added experimental --stripped option for playhrt.

- added --skip option for 'writeloop' with input from a file.

- added --dsync option for 'bufhrt', to force fast writing to hardware.

- added utility 'resample_soxr' for highest quality resampling with
  64 bit operations (abilities of reading files as with 'cat64' and 
  filtering output as with 'volrace' are built into this program).

- added utility 'cat64' to translate audio file or shared memory to 
  raw 64 bit floating point samples.

- added option --max-bad-reads to 'playhrt' (program stops when given 
  number of input blocks was too small, the value 4 was hardcoded before)

- added option --force-shm to 'writeloop' (overwrites semaphores left
  over from other calls).

- now using 'memclean' in 'writeloop'.

- using additional register/variable for refreshing of memory. Causes
  again a surprising improvement of sound in my system.

- various improvements in wording of help texts and verbose messages.

- new options --no-buf-stats and --no-delay-stats and explanation of
  "delayed loops" in 'playhrt'.

- added --verbose option to 'shmcat', 'catloop', 'writeloop'
  and 'volrace'.

- introduced --sleep=Nus option to 'playhrt', to give input programs
  time for startup.

- corrected the arguments of 'shmcat' in two example scripts.

0.6 to 0.7

Comments for users of previous versions: Five main ideas went into this
release, each of these cause audible improvements in my setup:

(1) Use of the mmap interface in ALSA with playhrt. This reduces the
    copying of audio data and makes the patch of the ALSA library which
    was proposed in previous versions unnecessary. It may be necessary to
    use a slightly larger hardware buffer than before for the audio
    device (--hw-buffer option).

(2) Optional use of shared memory in various places. Shared memory can be used
    to transfer data between different programs. Compared to a transfer via
    files this avoids file system overhead, and compared to transfer via pipes
    this avoids (difficult to control and understand) buffer management by
    the operating system.

(3) Cleaning RAM before writing, and refreshing data in RAM. The content of
    RAM also gets refreshed on hardware level. With explicit reading and
    rewriting of data in RAM (which look superfluous on the programming
    level) we try to represent data "cleaner" in RAM before they are sent
    to the next program or to the next computer or to the sound device.
    This leads to surprising audible improvements in my setup. Several
    variants were tested over longer periods, for ARM computers we
    provide assembler code.

(4) From experiments I found that the physical representation of music
    files on a hard disk influences the sound quality during playback,
    even if the data are heavily processed before playback. This release
    contains a script 'improvefile' which uses bufhrt to produce a
    bit identical copy of a file on a hard disk. I have tried this for many
    music files on my hard disk and made an audible comparison of the two
    files, the copied file always sounded "better" and in some cases it
    revealed remarkably more details of the music. I have not made
    experiments with SSDs.

(5) To make it easier to use this package we provide several example
    scripts which are explained on the webpage
        http://frank_l.bitbucket.org/stereoutils/player.html

And here is a more detailed list of CHANGES.

- new scripts: 'improvefile' for bit identical but different sounding
  files on hard disks; 'play_*' as an example script for playback of
  a music files using this package. (Some example files from former releases
  were removed).

- new utility functions used by cptoshm, shmcat, bufhrt and playhrt:
  refreshmem and memclean are used to rewrite data in RAM, respectively
  to clean RAM before overwriting, assembler versions are provided for
  ARM and ARM-vfp architectures

- bufhrt: added --shared input option, can be used directly with writeloop
  and without a pipe from catloop (so that the operating system has fewer
  buffers to maintain)

- all programs: numerous improvements in the documentation and in the
  information printed with --verbose flags 

- playhrt: new option --mmap which uses the low level mmap driver interface
  of ALSA drivers (in contrast to aplay). This mode is now recommended, even
  over the version with a patched ALSA library, as was suggested in
  version 0.6.

- playhrt: new option --number-channels for use with multi-channel setups

- writeloop: allow input from file via --from-file option

- writeloop and catloop: introduce --shared option for using shared memory
  instead of files

- new utilities cptoshm and shmcat: copy data to a shared memory region in
  RAM, respectively write these data to stdout

- bufhrt: introduced --interval mode, repeatedly buffers data without
  output and then outputs chunks with precise timing and no reading

0.5 to 0.6

- playhrt: now writes data directly after sleep, before loop that checks
  the result

- volrace did not work with 32-bit input, is fixed now (reported by
  lililinux)
