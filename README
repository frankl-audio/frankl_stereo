       frankl's stereo utilities
       =========================

This is a collection of programs and scripts to be used for stereo
playback via a computer.

These programs are free software, see files 'License.txt' and 'COPYING'
for details. Note in particular that using them is on your own risk.

Run a program with option '--help' to read its documentation.

Overview:

 - playhrt
      reads an audio stream from the network, stdin or a file and plays 
      it on a sound device

 - bufhrt
      reads data from stdin, a file, or the network and writes them
      to stdout, a network port or a file

 - volrace
      implements a simple form of the RACE algorithm and can be used
      for volume control

 - writeloop/catloop
      reads data from stdin and writes it cyclically to some files,
      and vice versa   (to buffer data in a ramdisk or shared memory)

 - cptoshm/shmcat
      writing and reading data to and from shared memory

 - resample_soxr
      standalone resampler in 64-bit operation using soxr library

 - cat64
      read sound file or shared memory and output samples as 64-bit
      floating point numbers

 - scripts/play_*
      example scripts for playing music with programs from this package
 
 - scripts/improvefile
      a tool to enhance audio quality of a music file

 - a few extra programs myplayhrt and *_c4 and by4 for the authors stereo
   setup (less well documented, may get incompatible changes, contain
   specific assembler code for Odroid C4)

The main idea of 'playhrt' and 'bufhrt' is that data are written in
very regular intervals using the highres timer functionality of the 
Linux kernel. Furthermore, data are refreshed in RAM before writing
them to the output stream.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
